# Generator Expressions in Python

## Introduction

Generator expressions in Python are a concise and memory-efficient way to create generators. They allow computations to be specified immediately within the expression and are similar to lambda functions but for generators.

## Understanding Generator Expressions

A **generator expression** is a way to create a generator using a syntax similar to list comprehensions but enclosed in parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`. Unlike list comprehensions, generator expressions are evaluated **lazily**, meaning values are computed only when needed, which saves memory and improves performance.

### Example:

```python
# Generator Expression
powers = (2**i for i in range(10))
```

This creates a generator that yields powers of `2` for `i` in the range of `0-9`. It does not create a list but instead generates values one at a time.

## Iterating Over a Generator Expression

Once we have a generator expression, we can iterate over it using a `for` loop:

```python
def main() -> None:
    powers = (2**i for i in range(10))
    for power in powers:
        print(power)
```

This prints each generated value one by one.

## Using Generator Expressions in Functions

Generators, like integers, floats, or functions, are objects that can be passed to other functions. A common example is passing a generator expression to the `sum()` function:

```python
print(sum(2**i for i in range(10)))
```

### Output:

```
1023
```

This efficiently computes the sum of powers of `2` without storing all intermediate values in memory.

## Generator Expressions vs. List Comprehensions

Both generator expressions and list comprehensions provide a concise way to create sequences. However, they differ in how they handle memory:

- **List Comprehensions** (`[...]`): Compute the entire list at once and store it in memory.
- **Generator Expressions** (`(...)`): Compute values lazily and yield them one by one, saving memory.

### Example Comparison:

```python
# List comprehension (creates full list in memory)
powers_list = [2**i for i in range(10)]

# Generator expression (evaluates lazily)
powers_gen = (2**i for i in range(10))
```

If working with large datasets, generator expressions are preferable since they avoid unnecessary memory usage.

## Corrected Code Implementation

```python
def main() -> None:
    powers = (2**i for i in range(10))
    for power in powers:
        print(power)

    # Using sum() with generator expression
    print(sum(2**i for i in range(10)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Summary

- **Generator expressions** are like list comprehensions but use parentheses `()` and evaluate lazily.
- They save memory by computing values only when needed.
- Can be used in functions like `sum()` for efficient computation.
- Unlike list comprehensions, they do not store values in memory, making them ideal for large data processing tasks.

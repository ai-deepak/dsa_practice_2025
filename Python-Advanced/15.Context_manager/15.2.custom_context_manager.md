# Using Context Managers in SQLite3 with Python

## Introduction

This document explains the use of context managers in Python when working with SQLite3. It highlights best practices for handling database connections to ensure resources are properly managed, even in the case of errors. Additionally, it demonstrates how to implement a custom context manager using a class.

## Understanding the Context Manager in SQLite3

### Without a Context Manager

The following code demonstrates how to use SQLite3 without a context manager:

```python
import logging
import sqlite3

def main():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    connection = sqlite3.connect("application.db")
    try:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM blogs")
        logging.info(cursor.fetchall())
    finally:
        connection.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Explanation:

- Establishes a connection to `application.db`.
- Uses a `try-finally` block to ensure the connection is closed after execution.
- If an exception occurs (e.g., querying a non-existent table), the `finally` block ensures that the connection is closed.

### Using SQLite3 as a Context Manager

Instead of manually managing the connection, we can use SQLite3’s built-in support for context managers:

```python
import logging
import sqlite3

def main():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    with sqlite3.connect("application.db") as connection:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM blogs")
        logging.info(cursor.fetchall())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Explanation:

- Uses `with sqlite3.connect("application.db") as connection:` to manage the connection automatically.
- The connection is closed automatically once the `with` block ends, even if an error occurs.
- This approach avoids the need for a `try-finally` block, making the code more readable and concise.

## Creating a Custom Context Manager

While SQLite3 provides a built-in context manager, a custom one can offer additional flexibility, such as logging when the connection is opened and closed.

```python
import sqlite3
import logging

class SQLite:
    def __init__(self, file_name: str):
        self.file_name = file_name
        self.connection = sqlite3.connect(self.file_name)

    def __enter__(self):
        logging.info("Calling __enter__")
        return self.connection.cursor()

    def __exit__(self, error: Exception, value: object, traceback: object):
        logging.info("Calling __exit__")
        self.connection.commit()
        self.connection.close()

def main():
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    with SQLite("application.db") as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM blogs")
        logging.info(cursor.fetchall())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### How the Custom Context Manager Works

1. **`__init__` method**:
   - Takes the database file name as input and establishes a connection.
2. **`__enter__` method**:
   - Logs that it has entered the context.
   - Returns a cursor object to execute queries.
3. **`__exit__` method**:
   - Logs that it has exited the context.
   - Commits transactions (if any changes were made).
   - Closes the connection automatically, even if an error occurs.

### Benefits of Using a Custom Context Manager:

- Ensures the connection is always closed, preventing resource leaks.
- Can incorporate additional logging or error handling logic.
- Can be extended for more advanced database transaction management.

## Summary

| Approach                     | Pros                                             | Cons                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Without Context Manager**  | Explicit control over connection handling.       | Requires `try-finally` for safety. |
| **Built-in Context Manager** | Automatic connection management.                 | Limited customization.             |
| **Custom Context Manager**   | Full control, enhanced logging, and reliability. | More boilerplate code.             |

Using Python’s context managers for SQLite3 ensures better resource management, making code more readable and robust against unexpected errors.

## Example Usage

### Querying the Database with Error Handling

Try running the following snippet with a valid and an invalid table name to see how the context manager behaves:

```python
with SQLite("application.db") as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM non_existent_table")  # This will cause an error
    logging.info(cursor.fetchall())
```

Even with an error, the `__exit__` method ensures that the connection is properly closed, preventing resource leaks.

This structured approach helps understand the importance of context managers in database management while providing a clean and maintainable way to handle SQLite connections.

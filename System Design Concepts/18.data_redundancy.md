# Resiliency and Data Redundancy

## Introduction

Resiliency in system design is crucial to ensure availability and reliability, especially concerning data redundancy and recovery. While API servers are typically **stateless**, databases are **stateful**, making them vulnerable to failures. A well-designed system accounts for catastrophic failures and ensures data redundancy.

## Stateless vs. Stateful Systems

### API Servers (Stateless)

- Stateless API servers do not store client-specific information.
- Requests can be handled by any server behind a **load balancer**.
- If an API server goes down, others continue handling requests seamlessly.

### Databases (Stateful)

- Databases store persistent data, making them **stateful**.
- A database failure can lead to a **complete outage**.
- The worst-case scenario is **disk failure**, leading to permanent data loss.
- Systems must implement **data redundancy** to handle such catastrophic failures.

## Data Redundancy Strategies

### 1. Backup and Restore

**Objective:** Ensure periodic snapshots of data are available for recovery.

#### Types of Backups:

1. **Daily Incremental Backups**
   - A full backup is taken once.
   - Daily changes are stored separately to minimize storage costs.
   - Allows recovery up to the last backup point.
2. **Weekly Full Backups**
   - Ensures a complete database copy is available.
   - Serves as a fallback if incremental backups are inconsistent.
3. **Offsite Backup for Disaster Recovery**
   - A copy of the data is stored in a geographically separate location.
   - Protects against regional disasters (e.g., data center failure due to flooding).

**Advantages:**

- Ensures some level of data is always available.
- Helps in quick restoration of operations.

### 2. Continuous Redundancy

**Objective:** Maintain real-time duplicate copies of data to ensure minimal downtime in case of a database crash.

#### Methods of Continuous Redundancy:

1. **Database Replication**
   - **Master-Replica Setup:**
     - One master database handles all writes.
     - One or more replicas continuously sync data from the master.
     - If the master fails, a replica can take over.
2. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Replication**

   - **Synchronous Replication:**

     - Data is written to both the master and replica at the same time.
     - Ensures data consistency but adds latency.

   - **Asynchronous Replication:**
     - Data is written to the master first, then propagated to replicas.
     - Faster but may result in minor data loss if the master crashes before replication occurs.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Critical data** should use synchronous replication.
- **Less critical data** can be backed up periodically.
- The **replica database** should remain in sync but not actively handle requests unless failover occurs.

## Practical Exercises

### 1. Set Up Replication Between Two MySQL Servers

- Configure one MySQL instance as a master and another as a replica.
- Test replication by writing to the master and verifying updates on the replica.

### 2. Perform a MySQL Backup

- Use MySQLâ€™s `mysqldump` command to back up data.
- Store the backup file securely for later restoration.

### 3. Restore a MySQL Database from Backup

- Use the backup file to restore data in case of failure.
- Validate that all data is intact and functional.

## Conclusion

Ensuring resiliency in databases requires a combination of **backup strategies** and **continuous redundancy mechanisms**. Implementing these techniques prevents data loss and ensures business continuity. Hands-on experience in setting up replication and backups will deepen understanding and prepare for real-world disaster recovery planning.

# **Asynchronous Processing**

## **Introduction**

Asynchronous processing is a fundamental concept in modern software development, where certain tasks are executed in the background without blocking the main execution flow. This is crucial for handling long-running tasks efficiently.

## **Synchronous Processing**

### **Definition**

Synchronous processing refers to the execution of tasks in a sequential order, where each task must complete before moving on to the next.

### **Examples**

1. **Loading Instagram Feed**

   - The user sends a request to Instagram.
   - The Instagram API queries the database.
   - The API returns the response immediately, displaying the feed.

2. **Logging into a Website**

   - The user enters email and password.
   - The website verifies the credentials.
   - The response is sent back immediately.

3. **Payments Processing**
   - Amount debited from one account.
   - Amount credited to another.
   - The transaction is completed synchronously.

## **Asynchronous Processing**

### **Definition**

Asynchronous processing allows tasks to be executed in the background while the system remains responsive. This is crucial for long-running tasks that do not require immediate completion.

### **Example: Spinning up an EC2 Instance**

- **Problem with Synchronous Processing:**

  - Spinning up an EC2 instance takes ~5 minutes.
  - A synchronous request would block the user for 5 minutes.

- **Solution with Asynchronous Processing:**
  - The user makes a request.
  - The system immediately responds with a status: `Processing...`.
  - The actual instance creation occurs in the background.
  - Once complete, the status updates to `Done`.

## **How Asynchronous Processing Works**

### **Flow of Asynchronous Requests**

1. **Client sends a request to API server.**
2. **API server does one of the following:**
   - Registers the task in a database.
   - Pushes the task to a message queue.
   - Immediately responds to the client with a status update.
3. **Worker nodes (background processors) pick up the task from the queue.**
4. **The worker processes the task and updates the database when done.**
5. **Client can check the status later.**

### **Example: Video Processing on YouTube**

1. A creator uploads a 1080p video.
2. The system needs to convert it into 360p, 480p, 720p, etc.
3. Instead of waiting synchronously, the system:
   - Uploads the video to S3.
   - Pushes a message to a message broker (e.g., SQS, RabbitMQ).
   - A background worker picks up the message.
   - The worker processes and uploads multiple resolutions back to S3.
   - The user can leave the page, as the process happens asynchronously.

## **Role of Message Brokers in Asynchronous Processing**

### **Definition**

Message brokers (or message queues) facilitate communication between different services asynchronously.

### **Key Benefits**

1. **Decoupling:**

   - The sender (e.g., API server) and receiver (e.g., worker) do not need to be online simultaneously.

2. **Buffering Messages:**

   - Messages can be stored until they are processed.
   - Prevents system overload.

3. **Failure Handling:**
   - If a worker fails before processing, the message can be requeued.

### **Example: Sending Order Confirmation Emails**

1. **Order service places an order.**
2. **A message is added to the queue:** `Send email to user@example.com`.
3. **Email worker picks up the message and sends the email.**
4. **If the worker crashes before sending, the message remains in the queue.**
5. **The system retries sending until it succeeds.**

## **Message Broker Features**

### **Message Retention**

- Messages are stored for a configurable time (e.g., AWS SQS allows up to 14 days).
- If unprocessed within the retention period, messages are discarded.

### **Requeueing Messages**

- If a message is consumed but not successfully processed, it can be requeued.
- Example: If an email sender crashes, the message is re-added to the queue for retry.

## **Use Cases of Asynchronous Processing**

1. **Video Encoding/Decoding**
2. **Large File Uploads**
3. **Background Data Processing**
4. **Notification Systems**
5. **Triggering Dependent Tasks**

## **Conclusion**

Asynchronous processing improves efficiency and responsiveness in modern applications, especially for long-running tasks. Message brokers play a critical role in handling background tasks efficiently, ensuring reliability and scalability.

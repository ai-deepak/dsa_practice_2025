# Understanding Real-Time PubSub

## Introduction

Real-time **Publish-Subscribe (PubSub)** systems are similar to **message streams** and **message brokers** but differ significantly in how they deliver messages. Traditional message brokers and message streams rely on consumers pulling messages, whereas real-time PubSub pushes messages to subscribers instantly.

## Message Brokers vs. Real-Time PubSub

### Message Brokers & Streams

- In message brokers (e.g., **Amazon SQS, Kafka**) and message streams (e.g., **Kinesis**), consumers pull messages from the broker.
- This allows consumers to process messages at their own pace while messages remain buffered in the queue.

### Real-Time PubSub

- Instead of **pulling**, real-time PubSub **pushes** messages to subscribers instantly.
- If an event is published, it is immediately broadcast to all subscribers.

## Example: Redis PubSub

### What is Redis PubSub?

**Redis**, commonly known as a caching database, also provides a PubSub mechanism.

- Subscribers can subscribe to a **channel**.
- Publishers send messages to the channel.
- **Redis pushes** the message instantly to all subscribers without them having to pull it.

### Advantages of Redis PubSub

1. **Low Latency Communication**: Messages are delivered instantly, making it suitable for real-time applications.
2. **Efficient Broadcast**: Useful when the same message needs to be sent to multiple subscribers simultaneously.

### Real-World Applications

1. **Messaging Systems**:
   - Used in chat applications where messages need to be delivered in real time.
2. **Configuration Push**:
   - Example: API servers connected to Redis PubSub receive configuration updates instantly when one server updates its configuration.
3. **Live Notifications**:
   - Used in financial trading applications, live sports updates, etc.

## Limitations of Redis PubSub

- **No Message Persistence**:
  - If a subscriber joins after a message is published, it **wonâ€™t receive past messages**.
  - Redis does **not buffer or store** messages.
- **Subscribers Must Be Online**:
  - Only active subscribers at the moment of publishing receive messages.

## Hands-On Exercise

### Steps to Test Redis PubSub

1. **Set Up Redis Locally**
2. **Go Through Redis PubSub Documentation**
3. **Run a Simple Hello World Example**:
   - Open multiple terminal windows.
   - Create **4 subscribers** and **1 publisher**.
   - Publish a message and observe how all subscribers receive it instantly.
4. **Test Message Persistence**:
   - Send **10 messages**.
   - Add a **new subscriber**.
   - Observe whether it receives past messages (Spoiler: It does not!).

## Conclusion

Redis PubSub is an excellent tool for **real-time** messaging and **event-driven** architectures. However, due to its lack of message persistence, it is best suited for **instant broadcasts** rather than long-term message retention. Understanding its limitations is crucial when designing systems that rely on real-time messaging.

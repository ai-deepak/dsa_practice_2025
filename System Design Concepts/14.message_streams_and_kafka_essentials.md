# Understanding Message Streams

## Introduction

Previously, we explored **message queues**. Now, let's discuss **message streams**, which are similar but have key differences. One of the most well-known tools for message streams is **Apache Kafka**. Understanding message streams helps us determine where they fit in system architectures and what benefits they provide out of the box.

## Understanding Message Queues

### Example: Medium.com Blog Processing

Consider we are building **Medium.com**, where users publish blogs. When a user publishes a blog, we need to perform two actions:

1. **Index the blog in Elasticsearch** (to enable search functionality).
2. **Update the user's total post count** in the database.

### Implementing with Message Queues

One way to implement this is by using **RabbitMQ**:

1. The **API server** stores the new blog in the database and pushes a message to RabbitMQ.
2. A **consumer** pulls the message from RabbitMQ and:
   - Indexes it in Elasticsearch.
   - Updates the database to increment the post count.

#### Issue: Inconsistency

If one operation succeeds while the other fails (e.g., indexing in Elasticsearch succeeds but the database update fails), the system ends up in an **inconsistent state**.

### Attempt to Solve Using Multiple Queues

To mitigate this, we could use **two separate RabbitMQ queues**:

1. One queue for **search indexing**.
2. One queue for **post count updates**.

This ensures:

- If one consumer fails, the other still functions, leading to eventual consistency.
- However, the **API server must write to two queues**, introducing another failure point: if the server crashes after writing to one queue but before the second, inconsistency still arises.

### Root Cause of the Problem

The core issue is **writing to multiple places** from the API server. Ideally, the API server should **write once**, and multiple consumers should be able to process the same message. This is where **message streams** come in.

## Introduction to Message Streams

### Key Concept

Message streams are similar to message queues but with one critical difference:

- **Message queues** send messages to **one** of multiple consumers performing the same task.
- **Message streams** allow **multiple different consumers** to read the **same** message.

### Example: Using Kafka for Blog Processing

With Kafka:

1. The **API server writes a single event** to Kafka.
2. Multiple consumer groups process the event independently:
   - The **search service** indexes the blog in Elasticsearch.
   - The **counter service** updates the post count in the database.

This ensures:

- The **API server writes only once**.
- Different consumers read the same event without inconsistency.

### Message Queues vs. Message Streams

| Feature            | Message Queues (e.g., RabbitMQ)                | Message Streams (e.g., Kafka)                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Message Processing | Each message is processed by **one** consumer. | Each message can be processed by **multiple** consumers.  |
| Use Case           | Multiple consumers doing the **same task**.    | Multiple consumers doing **different tasks**.             |
| Message Retention  | Messages are deleted after consumption.        | Messages are **retained** and can be read multiple times. |
| Consumers          | Consumers pull messages **individually**.      | Consumers **iterate over messages**.                      |

## How Kafka Works

### Message Storage and Consumption

- Messages are stored in **Kafka topics**.
- Messages remain in Kafka **forever** (configurable retention policies exist).
- Consumers **iterate over messages** instead of removing them from the queue.

### Consumer Groups

Kafka introduces **consumer groups**, where:

- Each **consumer group** processes messages independently.
- Multiple consumers within a group **share** messages.
- Different consumer groups can read **all messages**.

### Example of Consumer Groups

1. A **search consumer group** indexes blogs in Elasticsearch.
2. A **counter consumer group** updates the database.
3. A new **analytics consumer group** can be added without affecting others.

## Conclusion

Message streams, like Kafka, solve the issues of message queues by enabling **write-once, read-many** semantics. This allows:

- **Multiple independent consumers** to process the same message.
- **Fault tolerance**, as messages are retained and can be reprocessed.
- **Scalability**, as new consumer groups can be added without disrupting existing ones.

Kafka and other message stream platforms (e.g., AWS Kinesis) are powerful tools for building **reliable, scalable, and event-driven architectures**.

# Relational Databases

Databases are the most critical component of any system; they can make or break a system.

If you solve your database problem well, you solve 50% of your system problem.  
Relational databases store and represent data in rows and columns.

## History of Relational Databases

- Everything "revolutionary" starts with financial applications.
- Computers first did "accounting" → ledgers → rows and columns → tables.
- Databases were initially developed to support accounting.

### Key Properties of Early Databases

1. Data consistency
2. Data durability
3. Data integrity
4. Constraints
5. Everything in one place

Because of these reasons, relational databases provide **"transactions"**!

## ACID Properties

1. **Atomicity**: All statements within a transaction take effect or none.
2. **Consistency**: Data will never go incorrect, no matter what happens.
3. **Isolation**: Parallel transactions do not interfere with one another.
4. **Durability**: Once a transaction commits, changes outlive any outage.

Atomicity: All statements within a transaction takes effect or none.

eg:

- Start transaction
- publish a post and increase the post count
  - insert into posts values (...)
  - update stats set total_posts = total_posts + 1 where id = 1
- commit

**Example of Atomicity in Relational Database:**

Atomicity is one of the key properties of a database transaction. It ensures that a series of operations within a transaction are treated as a single unit of work. This means that either all the operations in the transaction are successfully completed, or none of them are applied (if any operation fails). This is often referred to as the "all-or-nothing" principle.

### Scenario: Bank Account Transfer

Let's say you have two bank accounts, **Account A** and **Account B**, and you want to transfer $100 from **Account A** to **Account B**. The operation involves two main actions:

1. **Debit $100 from Account A**
2. **Credit $100 to Account B**

If any of these operations fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back, and neither of the accounts should be modified.

### SQL Example:

Here’s how you might structure this as a transaction in SQL:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Step 1: Debit $100 from Account A
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 100
WHERE account_id = 'A';

-- Step 2: Credit $100 to Account B
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 100
WHERE account_id = 'B';

-- Commit the transaction if both steps succeed
COMMIT;
```

### If an Error Occurs:

If, for example, the second update (credit to Account B) fails due to a database error, the entire transaction will be rolled back, meaning **Account A** will not lose the $100 either.

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

### Key Points:

- **Atomicity** ensures that the debit and credit operations are treated as a single transaction.
- If both operations succeed, the transaction is **committed**, and the changes are saved.
- If either operation fails, the transaction is **rolled back**, and no changes are made to either account.

This guarantees that the transfer operation is "atomic" — either it happens completely or not at all.

consistency:

data will never go incorrect, no matter what happens.

constraints, cascades, triggers

eg: Foreign key checks do not allow you to delete parent if child exists <-- \* can be funed.

you have the necessary tools to ensure that your data never goes inconsistent.

total_posts = total entries in posts table for a blog.

### Consistency in Relational Databases: Detailed Explanation

Consistency is one of the four key properties of database transactions, encapsulated by the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). It ensures that the database remains in a **valid state** before and after a transaction, even in the presence of failures.

### Key Aspects of Consistency

1. **Data Integrity**  
   Consistency ensures that all defined rules and constraints in the database schema are satisfied during and after any transaction. The database moves from one valid state to another.

   For example, if you have a **foreign key constraint**, any transaction that violates this rule will fail, preventing the database from entering an inconsistent state.

2. **Tools for Enforcing Consistency**
   Relational databases provide several mechanisms to enforce consistency:

   - **Constraints**: Define rules like primary keys, foreign keys, unique keys, and check constraints.
   - **Cascades**: Automate actions like updating or deleting related rows when a parent row is modified or removed.
   - **Triggers**: Execute predefined logic automatically before or after specific database operations to ensure consistency.

3. **Validation of Business Rules**  
   Consistency enforces business rules across the database. For instance, ensuring the sum of account balances in a banking system does not change after a transfer operation.

### Examples of Consistency in Action

#### Example 1: Foreign Key Constraint

If you have two tables:  
**Blog** and **Posts**, with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Blog (
    blog_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Posts (
    post_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    blog_id INT,
    content TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (blog_id) REFERENCES Blog(blog_id)
);
```

**Foreign Key Behavior**:

- If you try to delete a blog (parent) that has associated posts (child), the database will prevent the operation unless you specifically handle it with cascading rules.
- You cannot insert a post with a `blog_id` that does not exist in the `Blog` table.

---

#### Example 2: Using Triggers for Consistency

Suppose you want to maintain a `total_posts` column in the `Blog` table that keeps track of the number of posts in the `Posts` table.

You can achieve this with a trigger:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_total_posts
AFTER INSERT ON Posts
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE Blog
    SET total_posts = total_posts + 1
    WHERE blog_id = NEW.blog_id;
END;
```

This ensures that whenever a post is added, the `total_posts` column in the corresponding blog entry is updated automatically.

---

#### Example 3: Check Constraint

You want to ensure that the `total_posts` in the `Blog` table matches the number of entries in the `Posts` table. While direct validation may not always be feasible, you can implement checks to ensure valid input.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Blog (
    blog_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    total_posts INT CHECK (total_posts >= 0)
);
```

---

### What Happens During Failures?

If a transaction violates a constraint, trigger, or business rule:

- The transaction is rolled back.
- The database remains in its previous valid state, avoiding any inconsistencies.

For instance:

- If a foreign key constraint is violated, the operation will not be committed.
- If a trigger fails (e.g., an error in the logic), the entire transaction will fail unless specifically handled.

---

### Key Takeaway

Consistency ensures that **data integrity rules are always upheld**. No matter what operations are performed or failures occur, the database transitions between valid states. This is achieved through tools like **constraints, cascades, triggers, and validation mechanisms**.

Durability:

when transaction commits, the changes outlives the outage.

Isolation:

    when multiple transactions are executing parallely,
    the isolation level determines how much changes of one transaction are visible to other transactions.

### **Durability and Isolation in ACID**

#### **1. Durability**

**Durability** ensures that once a transaction has been committed, its changes are permanent, even in the event of a system crash, power failure, or other catastrophic events.

##### Key Points:

- Committed transactions are guaranteed to persist.
- Uses mechanisms like **write-ahead logs**, **journaling**, and **checkpoints** to ensure durability.
- Changes are saved to non-volatile storage before confirming the transaction.

##### **Example of Durability**:

Imagine an e-commerce system where a user places an order. The following steps occur:

1. User makes a payment for an order.
2. The system updates the order status to "Confirmed."
3. The database commits the transaction.

If the system crashes immediately after the transaction is committed, the changes (payment and order status) remain safe and are restored when the system restarts.

**Implementation**:

- The database writes the changes to disk before sending an acknowledgment to the application.

---

#### **2. Isolation**

**Isolation** ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction is executed in isolation, as if it were the only transaction in the system. This prevents problems like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

##### Isolation Problems Explained:

- **Dirty Read**: Reading uncommitted changes made by another transaction.
- **Non-Repeatable Read**: Reading the same data twice during a transaction, but the value changes because another transaction modified it.
- **Phantom Read**: A transaction reads a set of rows that match a condition. Another transaction inserts or deletes rows that affect this set during the first transaction.

---

#### **Levels of Isolation** (SQL Standard)

1. **Read Uncommitted**:

   - **Description**: The lowest level of isolation. Transactions can read uncommitted changes from other transactions.
   - **Use Case**: Rarely used, suitable for scenarios where performance is more critical than accuracy.
   - **Issue**: Allows dirty reads.

   **Example**:

   ```sql
   Transaction A: UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 'A';
   Transaction B: SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 'A';
   ```

   Transaction B might see the uncommitted balance update.

2. **Read Committed**:

   - **Description**: A transaction can only read committed changes. Dirty reads are not allowed.
   - **Use Case**: Commonly used, ensures moderate consistency without significant performance overhead.
   - **Issue**: Allows non-repeatable reads.

   **Example**:

   ```sql
   Transaction A: UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 'A'; COMMIT;
   Transaction B: SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 'A';
   ```

   Transaction B only sees the committed balance.

3. **Repeatable Read**:

   - **Description**: Ensures that if a transaction reads data, no other transaction can modify it until the first transaction completes.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable when consistency is critical but phantom reads are tolerable.
   - **Issue**: Allows phantom reads.

   **Example**:

   ```sql
   Transaction A: SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE balance > 1000;
   Transaction B: INSERT INTO accounts (account_id, balance) VALUES ('C', 1200);
   ```

   Transaction A might not see the newly inserted account.

4. **Serializable**:

   - **Description**: The highest level of isolation. Transactions are completely isolated from each other, as if executed serially.
   - **Use Case**: Critical for financial systems or scenarios where absolute consistency is required.
   - **Issue**: Highest performance cost.

   **Example**:

   ```sql
   Transaction A: SELECT SUM(balance) FROM accounts;
   Transaction B: INSERT INTO accounts (account_id, balance) VALUES ('C', 1200);
   ```

   Transaction B will have to wait until Transaction A completes.

#### Summary of Isolation Levels:

| Isolation Level  | Dirty Reads | Non-Repeatable Reads | Phantom Reads |
| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Read Uncommitted | Yes         | Yes                  | Yes           |
| Read Committed   | No          | Yes                  | Yes           |
| Repeatable Read  | No          | No                   | Yes           |
| Serializable     | No          | No                   | No            |

### **Durability and Isolation in Practice**

In relational databases, **durability** and **isolation** work together to ensure that transactions:

- Maintain consistency in the face of concurrent access (isolation).
- Are permanent and recoverable in the face of failures (durability).

Using **isolation levels**, you can balance between strict consistency and performance based on your application’s needs.

Remember
you pick relational databased for relations and acid.

Exercise 1. setup a SQL database (mysql or postgres) 2. create a schema for a social network
a. users, posts, profile, photos, following etc -> define the relations 3. Insert data in (users & Profile) in one transaction

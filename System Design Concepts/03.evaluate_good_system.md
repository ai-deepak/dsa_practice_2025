# How Do You Know You Have Built a Good System?

Here are some pointers to evaluate your system:

## 1. You Broke Down the System into Components

Example:  
Feed components can be broken down into:

- **Generator**
- **Aggregator**
- **Webserver**

---

## 2. Every Component Has a Clear Set of Responsibilities

In most cases, these responsibilities need to be exclusive. The responsibility of one component should not overlap with another.

### Example:

- **Feed Webserver**: Serves the feed over HTTP.
- **Feed Generator**: Pulls data (candidate feed items) from multiple services (e.g., posts, friends, recommendations) and stores them in a temporary database.
- **Feed Aggregator**: Fetches input from the database, combines candidate items, filters out redundant items, ranks them, and creates a final consumable feed for the database.

---

## 3. For Each Component, You Have Addressed the Following:

- **Database and Caching**
- **Scaling and Fault Tolerance**
- **Async Processing (Delegation)**
- **Communication Between Components**

---

## 4. Each Component (in Isolation) Is:

- **Scalable**: Can handle increased load by adding resources.
- **Fault Tolerant**: Can handle failures gracefully.
- **Available**: Can handle requests without downtime.

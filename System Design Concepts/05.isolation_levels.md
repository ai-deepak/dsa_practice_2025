Let's explore how **isolation** and **isolation levels** work in the context of a **social media application** like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, where multiple users might interact with shared data simultaneously.

---

### **1. Read Uncommitted**

#### Scenario: Viewing Uncommitted Posts

- User A writes a new post: "Excited about my new project!"
- Before User A presses "Post" (commits the transaction), User B opens the feed and sees the uncommitted post.

#### Example:

1. **Transaction A (User A posts)**:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO posts (user_id, content) VALUES (1, 'Excited about my new project!');
   -- No COMMIT yet
   ```

2. **Transaction B (User B views the feed)**:
   ```sql
   SELECT content FROM posts WHERE user_id = 1;
   ```
   - **Problem**: User B sees the post even though it hasn’t been officially shared.

---

### **2. Read Committed**

#### Scenario: Commenting on a Post

- User A makes a new post: "Hello World!" and commits it.
- User B wants to comment on the post but can only interact with it after it’s committed.

#### Example:

1. **Transaction A (User A posts)**:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO posts (user_id, content) VALUES (1, 'Hello World!');
   COMMIT;
   ```

2. **Transaction B (User B comments)**:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO comments (post_id, user_id, comment) VALUES (1, 2, 'Welcome!');
   ```

   - User B can only interact with committed posts.
   - **Problem**: If User B views the post and User A edits it before User B interacts, User B may see inconsistent data.

---

### **3. Repeatable Read**

#### Scenario: Liking a Post

- User A views the likes count on a post.
- While viewing, User B adds a like, but User A continues to see the same likes count until their session completes.

#### Example:

1. **Transaction A (User A views likes count)**:

   ```sql
   SELECT likes FROM posts WHERE post_id = 1;
   ```

   - Locks the row for consistent reads.

2. **Transaction B (User B likes the post)**:

   ```sql
   UPDATE posts SET likes = likes + 1 WHERE post_id = 1;
   ```

   - **Blocked**: User A's session has locked the likes count, ensuring User A sees a consistent value.

3. **Transaction A** completes, and only then Transaction B proceeds.

---

### **4. Serializable**

#### Scenario: Following a User

- User A views the list of followers.
- During this, User B tries to follow User A, but the system ensures that User A sees a completely stable view of their followers list.

#### Example:

1. **Transaction A (User A views followers)**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM followers WHERE user_id = 1;
   ```

   - Locks the table or rows matching the condition.

2. **Transaction B (User B follows User A)**:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_id) VALUES (1, 2);
   ```

   - **Blocked**: User A has locked the rows/table, preventing any changes during the transaction.

3. **Transaction A** finishes, ensuring no "phantom followers" appear in the list User A sees.

### **Comparison in a Social Media Context**

| Isolation Level      | Example Use Case                                                     | Trade-offs                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read Uncommitted** | Viewing posts before they’re officially shared.                      | High concurrency, inaccurate data.                   |
| **Read Committed**   | Interacting with posts (like, comment) only after they’re committed. | Moderate consistency, avoids dirty reads.            |
| **Repeatable Read**  | Viewing likes or comments on a post consistently.                    | Prevents non-repeatable reads, allows phantom reads. |
| **Serializable**     | Viewing a follower list that doesn’t change during the transaction.  | Highest consistency, lowest concurrency.             |

### **Key Takeaways for Social Media Apps**

- Use **Read Committed** for most interactions like viewing or commenting on posts, ensuring no dirty reads.
- Use **Repeatable Read** for scenarios requiring consistent data, like viewing likes or shares.
- Use **Serializable** for critical operations, such as transactions involving financial data (e.g., purchasing ads) or ensuring stable follower lists.

By choosing the right isolation level, social media platforms balance data accuracy and system performance.

# Circuit Breakers: Preventing Cascading Failures

## Introduction

Circuit breakers are essential infrastructure components that prevent **cascading failures** in distributed systems. Before diving into circuit breakers, let's first understand what cascading failure means.

## Understanding Cascading Failures

A **cascading failure** occurs when the failure of one system component leads to the failure of other dependent components, eventually causing a complete system outage.

### Example of Cascading Failure

Consider a **social network application** that serves a **personalized feed** to users. The feed service depends on multiple microservices:

1. **Feed Service**

   - Retrieves posts for the user feed.
   - Depends on the **Recommendation Service** and **Trending Service**.

2. **Recommendation Service**

   - Suggests posts based on user activity.
   - Depends on **Profile Service** to fetch user details.

3. **Trending Service**

   - Identifies trending posts.
   - Depends on **Post Service** to retrieve post details.

4. **Post Service**

   - Fetches post content.
   - Depends on **Profile Service** to get author details.

5. **Profile Service**

   - Retrieves user profile data.
   - Depends on **Profile Database**.

6. **Post Database & Profile Database**
   - Stores post and profile data.

### How Cascading Failures Happen

Now, suppose the **Profile Database** experiences high load and slows down. This slowness cascades:

1. **Profile Service** slows down because it can't fetch data quickly.
2. **Post Service** slows down because it depends on Profile Service.
3. **Trending and Recommendation Services** slow down because they rely on Post and Profile Services.
4. **Feed Service** slows down as all its dependencies are affected.
5. **End users experience slow response times or timeouts.**

Eventually, if services time out, they **consume too many TCP connections**, causing **server resource exhaustion** and **system-wide failure**.

## The Role of Circuit Breakers in Preventing Failures

A **circuit breaker** helps mitigate cascading failures by **monitoring the health of services** and **blocking calls to unhealthy services**.

### How Circuit Breakers Work

1. **Monitor Service Health**

   - Track failure rates and response times of dependencies.

2. **Trip the Circuit**

   - If failures exceed a threshold, mark the service as **unhealthy** and **stop sending requests**.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**

   - Serve **default responses** or **cached data** instead of failing outright.

4. **Reset and Recovery**
   - Periodically check if the service has recovered.
   - If healthy, resume sending requests.

### Example with Circuit Breaker

Revisiting our social network example:

- If **Profile Service** is unhealthy:
  - **Recommendation Service** **does not** request profile details.
  - It **returns default values** (e.g., "Guest User").
- This prevents **timeouts** and keeps the system operational.

## Implementing a Circuit Breaker

Circuit breakers are **not databases** but rather a **design pattern** that can be implemented manually or through libraries like **Hystrix (Java), Resilience4j (Java), Polly (.NET), and Istio (Kubernetes)**.

### Basic Manual Implementation

1. **Circuit Breaker Database**

   - Store **service health statuses** (`true/false`).
   - Example: `profile_service_healthy = false`

2. **Middleware Checks Before Requests**

   - Before calling a service, check the **circuit breaker DB**.
   - If the service is down, return a **default response**.

3. **Manual vs. Automated Control**
   - Start with **manual toggling** (`true/false` flag).
   - Later, automate based on **failure thresholds** and **timeouts**.

### Example Implementation

#### Step 1: Circuit Breaker Database (Key-Value Store)

| Service Name    | Healthy? |
| --------------- | -------- |
| profile_service | false    |
| post_service    | true     |

#### Step 2: Service Check Before API Call

```python
def call_service(service_name):
    if circuit_breaker_db[service_name]:  # Check if service is healthy
        return request_service(service_name)
    else:
        return "Default Response"  # Serve fallback
```

#### Step 3: Auto-Recovery (Optional)

- Periodically **ping** the service.
- If healthy again, **flip the flag back to `true`**.

## Summary

- **Cascading failures** occur when one slow or failing service brings down the entire system.
- **Circuit breakers** prevent failures from propagating by **blocking** calls to unhealthy services.
- They can return **default responses**, **fail gracefully**, and **recover automatically**.
- Implementation can be **manual** (config flags) or **automated** (libraries like Hystrix, Istio).

## ðŸš€ Exercise: Implement a Simple Circuit Breaker

1. Create a **database table** or **key-value store** to track service health.
2. Write a simple **middleware function** that checks service health before making API calls.
3. Implement **a fallback mechanism** (e.g., return cached/default data when a service is down).
4. Experiment with **timeouts and automatic recovery**.

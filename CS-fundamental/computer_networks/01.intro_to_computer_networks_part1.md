# Computer Networks - Notes

## Introduction

- A **computer network** is formed when two or more devices are connected.
- Devices in a network share data, perform computations, or share resources.
- Example: Two computers connected to a printer for resource sharing.
- Computer networks exist everywhere:
  - **Home**: Laptops, Alexa, smart devices connected in a network.
  - **Office**: Computers connected through switches, routers, and other networking devices.
- The **Internet** is the largest network, connecting nearly half of the worldâ€™s population.

## Key Challenges in Computer Networks

1. **Reliability**: Ensuring that data is transmitted and received without errors.
2. **Scalability**: Managing the growth of connected devices without failures.
3. **Addressing & Bandwidth Allocation**:
   - Ensuring each device has a unique address.
   - Preventing a single device or network from consuming all bandwidth.
4. **Security**: Ensuring secure transmission of data between users and servers.
5. **Other Challenges**: Many other issues arise as networks expand and evolve.

## Career Perspective

### For Students

- Essential for exams like **GATE** and **government exams**.
- Important in technical interviews, especially after **Data Structures, DBMS, and Operating Systems**.
- Subjects like **compiler design** and **automata theory** are rarely asked, but **computer networks** are commonly tested.

### For Working Professionals

- **IT Support**:
  - Must understand **IP addressing, subnets, DHCP**, and other networking concepts.
  - Deep knowledge of **computer networks** is essential for troubleshooting and network management.
- **Application Developers**:
  - Crucial for web and network application development.
  - Must understand **application layer** and **transport layer protocols** like **TCP and UDP**.

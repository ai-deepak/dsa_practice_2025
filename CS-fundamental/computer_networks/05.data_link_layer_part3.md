# Error and Flow Control in Computer Networks

## Introduction

In this video, we will discuss **error and flow control** in computer networks. This is one of the most important and interesting topics in networking. The key aspect of this topic is that **error and flow control occur at two different layers**:

1. **Data Link Layer**
2. **Transport Layer**

## Error and Flow Control at Different Layers

The way error and flow control work differs between these two layers:

### **Data Link Layer**

- Devices are **physically close** to each other.
- **Bandwidth is high** and **speed is fast**.
- The **physical layer** can introduce **bit errors**, especially in wireless networks due to signal interference.
- The data link layer ensures that frames are received correctly and in order.
- If errors occur due to signal issues, **the frame is resent**.

### **Transport Layer**

- Devices can be **geographically far apart**.
- **Bandwidth varies** depending on the network links.
- **Propagation delay is significant** due to long distances.
- The transport layer works **on top of IP**, which is **connectionless and unreliable**.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** ensures that packets arrive **in order and without loss**.

## Why Do We Need Error and Flow Control?

### **Transport Layer (TCP)**

- Works on top of the **IP layer**, which does not guarantee reliable data transfer.
- Ensures packets are **delivered in order**.
- Handles **packet loss and retransmission**.

### **Data Link Layer**

- Works on top of the **physical layer**, which may introduce **bit errors**.
- **Wireless connections** are particularly prone to **frame loss** due to signal issues.
- Ensures that **damaged frames are resent**.

## Error Control Mechanisms

Error control is crucial to ensure **reliable communication**. The process follows these steps:

1. The **sender** sends a frame.
2. Due to signal issues (especially in wireless networks), **some bits may be altered**.
3. The **receiver checks the received frame** using **error detection techniques** such as:
   - **Parity Check**
   - **Checksum**
   - **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**
4. If an error is detected, the **receiver discards the frame**.
5. The **sender resends the frame** if necessary.

One effective method for handling errors is **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)**.

## **Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)**

ARQ allows the receiver to simply **discard a corrupt frame**, and the sender automatically figures out that it needs to **resend the frame**. There are different ARQ protocols:

1. **Stop-and-Wait ARQ**
2. **Go-Back-N ARQ**
3. **Selective Repeat ARQ**
4. **Sliding Window Protocol**

## **Stop-and-Wait ARQ**

### **Concept**

- The **sender transmits a frame** and **waits for an acknowledgment (ACK)** before sending the next frame.
- If the **ACK is received**, the next frame is sent.
- If the **ACK is not received** within a timeout period, the sender **retransmits** the frame.

### **Delays in Stop-and-Wait ARQ**

Understanding delays is crucial in networking. Let's break it down using a **truck analogy**:

1. **Transmission Delay (TT)**

   - The time required to **place a frame onto the channel**.
   - Analogy: The time a truck takes to completely enter the highway.

2. **Propagation Delay (TP)**

   - The time required for the frame to **travel through the network**.
   - Analogy: The time for the truck to reach the next toll station.

3. **Queuing Delay (TQ)**

   - The time a frame spends **waiting in a queue** at the receiver.
   - Analogy: The truck waiting at a toll booth.

4. **Processing Delay (TPR)**

   - The time taken for the receiver to **process the frame**.
   - Analogy: The time taken to check the truck at the toll booth.

5. **Acknowledgment Transmission Delay (TTX)**

   - The time required to **send an acknowledgment back to the sender**.

6. **Acknowledgment Propagation Delay (TP-ACK)**

   - The time required for the **ACK to reach the sender**.

### **Total Time for Frame Transmission**

Ignoring processing and queuing delays, the total time taken for a frame to be transmitted and acknowledged is:

\(T\_{total} = TT + 2TP\)

### **Efficiency of Stop-and-Wait ARQ**

Efficiency \(\eta\) is given by:

\(\eta = \frac{TT}{TT + 2TP}\)

### **Throughput**

Throughput (bits per second) is given by:

\(\text{Throughput} = \frac{L}{TT + 2TP}\)

Where:

- **L** = Frame length (bits)
- **TT** = Transmission delay
- **TP** = Propagation delay

## **Problems with Stop-and-Wait ARQ**

1. **Inefficiency**

   - The sender **waits too long** before sending the next frame.
   - This leads to **underutilization of bandwidth**.

2. **Lost Data**

   - If a frame is lost, the sender **waits for an acknowledgment that never arrives**.
   - Solution: **Timeout mechanism** – If no ACK is received within a timeout period, the sender retransmits the frame.

3. **Lost Acknowledgment**

   - If an acknowledgment is lost, the sender **resends the frame**, causing duplicates.
   - Solution: **Sequence numbering** – Each frame has a sequence number, so the receiver can identify duplicates.

4. **Delayed Data** - It will not be a problem because the receiver will not send acknowledgment.

5. **Delayed ack** - If an acknowledgment takes too long to reach the sender due to network congestion, processing delays, or retransmissions, the sender may timeout unnecessarily, leading to retransmissions even when the original frame was successfully received. If we attach sequence number even in acknowledgment, will help sender to identify that what type of frame it is. whether duplicate or not.

## **Improvements Over Stop-and-Wait ARQ**

To improve efficiency, two better protocols are used:

1. **Go-Back-N ARQ**

   - The sender sends **multiple frames** before waiting for an acknowledgment.
   - If an error occurs, **all subsequent frames are retransmitted**.

2. **Selective Repeat ARQ**

   - Only **corrupt or lost frames** are retransmitted instead of all frames.
   - More efficient than Go-Back-N.

Both protocols rely on the **Sliding Window Protocol**, which improves efficiency by allowing multiple frames to be in transit simultaneously.

## **Conclusion**

- **Error control** ensures **reliable communication** by detecting and retransmitting lost or corrupt frames.
- **Flow control** prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver.
- **Stop-and-Wait ARQ** is a basic method but **inefficient**.
- **Go-Back-N and Selective Repeat** improve efficiency.
- **Sliding Window Protocol** is used to optimize performance.

Understanding these concepts is fundamental for networking professionals, as they are widely used in **TCP/IP protocols and wireless communications**.

# Delays in Computer Networks

In this document, we will discuss different types of delays in computer networks, their dependencies, and formulas to calculate them.

## 1. Transmission Delay

**Definition:**
Transmission delay is the time taken by the sender to place a data packet onto the communication link.

**Factors Affecting Transmission Delay:**

- **Link Bandwidth (B):** The data transmission capacity of the communication channel.
- **Packet Length (L):** The size of the data packet in bits.

**Formula:**
\(\text{Transmission Delay} = \frac{L}{B}\)

**Example:**
If the bandwidth \(B\) is **100 bits per second** and the packet length \(L\) is **1000 bits**, the transmission delay is calculated as:
\(\frac{1000}{100} = 10 \text{ seconds}\)

Thus, the transmission delay for this input data is **10 seconds**.

## 2. Propagation Delay

**Definition:**
Propagation delay is the time taken by the last bit of a data packet to travel from the sender to the receiver.

**Factors Affecting Propagation Delay:**

- **Distance (D):** The physical separation between sender and receiver.
- **Propagation Speed (V):** The speed at which data travels through the medium (e.g., optical fiber, copper wire).

**Formula:**
\(\text{Propagation Delay} = \frac{D}{V}\)

**Propagation Speed Based on Medium:**

- **Fiber Optics:** ~~Speed of light (~~\(3 \times 10^8\) m/s)
- **Copper Wire/Twisted Pair:** \~59% to 77% of the speed of light

**Example:**
If the distance is **30 km** and the propagation speed is **\(3 \times 10^8\)\*\*** m/s\*\*, then:
\(\frac{30 \times 10^3}{3 \times 10^8} = 0.1 \text{ milliseconds}\)

Thus, the propagation delay is **0.1 ms**.

## 3. Queuing Delay

**Definition:**
Queuing delay is the time a data packet spends waiting in a queue before it is processed by a network device (e.g., router).

**Factors Affecting Queuing Delay:**

- **Router Load:** The number of packets being processed.
- **Traffic Conditions:** High congestion increases queuing delay.
- **Scheduling Algorithm:** The method used by routers to process packets.

**Note:** There is no fixed formula for queuing delay as it varies based on network conditions.

## 4. Processing Delay

**Definition:**
Processing delay is the time taken by a router to analyze the packet header, perform error checking, and determine the next hop.

**Factors Affecting Processing Delay:**

- **Router’s Computational Power:** More powerful routers process packets faster.
- **Load on Router:** A heavily loaded router takes longer to process packets.
- **Security Checks:** Encryption and decryption add to processing delay.

**Note:** Like queuing delay, processing delay has no fixed formula as it depends on the router’s load and computational capacity.

## 5. Sequence of Packet Transmission and Delays

To better understand how packets experience different types of delays, here is a sequence diagram of the process:

```
Sender --> [Transmission Delay] --> Communication Link --> [Propagation Delay] --> Router
  Router --> [Processing Delay] --> [Queuing Delay] --> Communication Link
  Communication Link --> [Transmission + Propagation Delay] --> Final Receiver
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sender** prepares the packet.
2. **Transmission Delay**: The packet is placed onto the communication link.
3. **Propagation Delay**: The packet travels through the medium to a router.
4. **Router (Intermediate Device)**
   - **Processing Delay**: The router examines the packet.
   - **Queuing Delay**: The packet waits in the router's queue.
5. **Transmission + Propagation Delay**: The router forwards the packet to the next router or final receiver.
6. **Final Receiver**: The packet arrives at its destination.

## 6. Total Delay Calculation

When transmitting a packet from a sender to a receiver, the total delay experienced is the sum of all four delays:
\(\text{Total Delay} = \text{Transmission Delay} + \text{Propagation Delay} + \text{Queuing Delay} + \text{Processing Delay}\)

In most cases:

- **Transmission and propagation delays** can be computed using formulas.
- **Queuing and processing delays** are either provided or assumed negligible.

## Summary of Delays

| Delay Type         | Formula (if applicable) | Depends On                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Transmission Delay | \(L / B\)               | Packet length, Link bandwidth        |
| Propagation Delay  | \(D / V\)               | Distance, Propagation speed          |
| Queuing Delay      | No fixed formula        | Router load, Traffic conditions      |
| Processing Delay   | No fixed formula        | Router speed, Packet processing time |

This structured breakdown provides a clear understanding of network delays and how they affect data transmission performance.

# Notes on Basics of Computer Networks

## Introduction

- Overview of computer networks.
- Discussion on OSI and TCP network models.

## Network Basics

- Example: Office computer connected to a **switch**.
  - **Switch**: Forms a Local Area Network (LAN).
- Switch is connected to a **router**.
  - **Router**: Connects one network to another (e.g., office to the internet).
- Web server is also connected to the internet, enabling website access.

## Computer Network Operations

- Various processes occur when browsing a website:
  - Connection establishment.
  - Pathfinding to the web server.
  - Communication with the web server.
  - Formatting request/response.
  - Bandwidth optimization.
  - Addressing and communication with new devices.

## Protocols

- **Definition**: Set of rules enabling communication between devices.
- Protocols determine message content and processing.
- Headers in protocols specify:
  - Destination address.
  - Source address.
  - Checksum for error detection.
- Common protocols:
  - **IP** (Internet Protocol)
  - **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)
  - **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol)
  - **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
  - **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

## Need for Layers

- Implementing everything in one protocol is inefficient.
- Layering simplifies network organization by dividing responsibilities.
- **Example**:
  - HTTP (Application Layer) does not manage transport services.
  - Application-layer code is independent of WiFi or wired connections.

## OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)

- Networks are structured as **layers**, each with specific protocols.
- **Layers in OSI Model** (7 layers):
  1. **Application** (e.g., HTTP, SMTP)
  2. **Presentation** (Data formatting, encryption)
  3. **Session** (Establishing communication sessions)
  4. **Transport** (Reliable data transfer, e.g., TCP, UDP)
  5. **Network** (Routing, e.g., IP)
  6. **Data Link** (Error detection, MAC addressing)
  7. **Physical** (Binary transmission, wired/wireless media)

## Data Transmission Process

1. Senderâ€™s **Application Layer** (e.g., browser) sends HTTP message.
2. Each lower layer adds its **own header** (encapsulation):
   - Transport layer adds TCP/UDP header.
   - Network layer adds IP header.
   - Data Link layer adds Ethernet/WiFi header.
3. Physical layer transmits as **binary data (0s and 1s)**.
4. Receiver processes headers **in reverse order**:
   - Data Link layer reads & removes Ethernet/WiFi header.
   - Network layer processes IP header.
   - Transport layer processes TCP/UDP header.
   - Application layer retrieves HTTP message.

## Importance of Layering

- **Encapsulation**: Each layer wraps data with necessary headers.
- **Protocol independence**: HTTP works without worrying about underlying network details.
- **Separation of concerns**: Each layer has defined responsibilities.

## OSI vs TCP/IP Model

- **OSI Model (7 Layers)**: Theoretical model, used as a reference.
- **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)**: Practical model, used in the internet.
  - Application
  - Transport
  - Internet (Network Layer equivalent)
  - Network Interface (Physical + Data Link Layers combined)
- OSI model is still relevant for learning and interviews.

## Conclusion

- Layers and protocols enable structured communication in networks.
- The OSI model helps understand network functions, while TCP/IP is widely used in real-world applications.

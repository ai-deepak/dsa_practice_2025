Let's analyze and compare **Solution 1** and **Solution 2** for solving the 3-sum problem, which requires finding unique triplets in an array that sum up to zero.

---

### **Solution 1: Two-Pointer Approach**

1. **Algorithm Overview:**

   - Sort the array.
   - Iterate through each element, treating it as the first element of the triplet.
   - Use two pointers (`j` and `k`) to find the other two elements that sum up to zero with the current element.
   - If the sum matches, add the triplet to a set to avoid duplicates.
   - Adjust pointers (`j` and `k`) based on the current sum being less or greater than zero.

2. **Time Complexity:**

   - Sorting: \( O(n \log n) \).
   - Outer loop (iterate through \( n \)): \( O(n) \).
   - Inner loop (two-pointer search): \( O(n) \) in the worst case.
   - Overall: \( O(n^2) \).

3. **Space Complexity:**

   - Storage for the result set: \( O(k) \), where \( k \) is the number of unique triplets.
   - Sorting is in-place, so no extra space for sorting.
   - Overall: \( O(k) \).

4. **Strengths:**

   - Simple and intuitive.
   - Efficient for medium-sized arrays due to the two-pointer optimization.
   - Handles duplicates by using a set to store unique triplets.

5. **Weaknesses:**
   - Requires sorting the array, which modifies the input.
   - Using a set for deduplication may have overhead in insertion and storage.

### **Solution 2: Dictionary-Based Frequency Counting**

1. **Algorithm Overview:**

   - Use dictionaries (`neg` and `pos`) to store counts of negative and positive numbers.
   - Handle zeroes separately.
   - For triplets involving a zero, check for pairs of opposite numbers in the positive and negative dictionaries.
   - For other triplets, iterate through pairs of elements in the same dictionary and find the third element in the opposite dictionary.

2. **Time Complexity:**

   - Building dictionaries: \( O(n) \).
   - Iterating through dictionary pairs:
     - For each pair of elements in one dictionary (\( O(n^2) \) in the worst case), check for the third element in the other dictionary (\( O(1) \) lookup).
   - Overall: \( O(n^2) \).

3. **Space Complexity:**

   - Requires additional space for the dictionaries (`neg` and `pos`): \( O(n) \).
   - Result list: \( O(k) \), where \( k \) is the number of unique triplets.
   - Overall: \( O(n + k) \).

4. **Strengths:**

   - Does not modify the input array.
   - Effectively avoids duplicates by leveraging dictionaries and count-based conditions.
   - Handles scenarios with many zeros well.

5. **Weaknesses:**
   - Higher space overhead due to the dictionaries.
   - More complex implementation compared to the two-pointer approach.
   - May not be as efficient as Solution 1 for larger datasets, depending on the distribution of numbers.

| **Handles Duplicates** | Using a set for triplets                | Count-based dictionary checks              |
| **Input Modification** | Sorts the input array                   | Does not modify the input                  |
| **Code Complexity**    | Simple and concise                      | More complex due to dictionary handling    |
| **Best Use Case**      | Medium-sized arrays with random numbers | Arrays with large duplicates or many zeros |

### **Which Solution is Better?**

- **Solution 1** is preferred for general use cases due to its simplicity and intuitive approach. It has less space overhead and is easier to implement and understand.
- **Solution 2** can be more suitable when the array contains many duplicate numbers or zeros, as it effectively handles these scenarios with count-based logic. However, it has higher space complexity and is harder to debug and maintain.
